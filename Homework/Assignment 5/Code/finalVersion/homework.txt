Assignment #5

I used the two unix tools grep and man. Grep has turned out to be a great tool to search using unix, while on putty to determine the location of strings for debugging (which file they were in). While that is pretty convenient, man is a much more promising command. Using it, I was able to learn a little better how to work gdb, and I have started using it a little bit. It looks to be a great tool that I can use to get help with many things that I do not understand in unix.

This occured when I was attempting to pass back data from the ADT to the client program.
I am not entirely sure as to what it means, so I cannot exactly supply a better alternative.

I figured out it meant there was extraneous text at the beginning of the file
This could have been replaced with something like: "Random text", "unrecognized text" or something else along those lines.

I did not recieve any other cryptic error messages while working on program #5

3)
 a) & b)  A heap and a heapsort both benefit when they are implemented using a complete binary tree because of the increase in preformance based on the assurance of a minimal height.
 c)  Depth first search can be easer to understand the process of the alogithm as a user, because it is more as a person would think, rather than finding all of the options first.
 d) It can greatly help user-interface if an adjacency's edges are sorted, as it can help sort the edges and make them easier to interpret.
