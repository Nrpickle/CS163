Lab #5 Plan

Requested data

Base case
  match == head->data;
  
Increment Step
  head->next
  
Get done before
  check for a match
 
After
  none
  
  
Insert number 9 after 2
i. !head
ii. head->next
iii. Check if the number is a 2
iv. Nothing

Display the last two items
i. head->next->next == NULL
ii. head->next
iii. check if the next next node is NULL
iv. Nothing


Same Length
i.  if (!head1 || !head2)
ii.
I would use a loop by traversing through both lists seperately and counting the nodes that they had
iii. This loop could be replaced by a recursive call that iterates both loops at the same time and checks if the next node is NULL on either of them, and if it is NULL on both of the nodes at the same time, then the lists are the same length.
It would need to compare the lists, then iterate if niether of the nodes are NULL
iv. Nothing
